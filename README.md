# Baby GPT - Simple Language Modeling Project

## Overview
Baby GPT is an exploratory project designed to incrementally build a GPT-like language model. The project begins with a simple Bigram Model and gradually incorporates advanced concepts from the Transformer model architecture.

## Detailed Steps in Model Architecture

### Data Preparation
- **Loading and Inspecting Data**: Initial data inspection and quality checks.
- **Characterization and Vocabulary**: Creation of a character set and corresponding integer mappings.

### Tokenization
- **Character Tokenization**: Mapping of characters to integers for model input.
- **Subword Tokenization**: (Optional) Using `tiktoken` for more advanced GPT-2-like tokenization.

### Data Splitting
- **Train/Test Split**: Segmentation of data into training and validation sets.

### Model Configuration
- **Hyperparameters**: Definition of batch size, block size, model dimensions, etc.
- **Adam Optimizer**: Configuration of the Adam optimizer for model training.

### Positional Encodings
- Before processing the input data through the attention mechanisms, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to maintain the order of the sequence.

### Self-Attention Mechanism
- **Dot Product**: Computation of the dot product between queries and keys to determine the relevance within the sequence.
- **Scaled Dot Product**: Scaling the dot product by the inverse square root of the dimensionality to stabilize gradients during training.

### Model Components
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Implementing attention with multiple heads to allow the model to focus on different positions of the input sequence.
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Non-linear processing of attention outputs.

### Building Blocks
- **Blocks**: Combining Multi-Head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks, along with Add & Norm steps within each block of the Transformer model.
- **Layer Normalization**: Normalizing the outputs within each block to stabilize training.

### Model Training
- **Loss Estimation**: Calculating the loss during training to evaluate model performance.
- **Training Loop**: Iterative optimization of model parameters based on computed gradients.

### Text Generation
- **Sequence Generation**: Using the trained model to generate text sequences from a given context.
